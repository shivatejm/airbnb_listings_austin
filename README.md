Developed and interpreted the linear relationship between neighborhood and prices; built statistical models to accurately predict an Airbnb Listing price based on significant factors.

Data source: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html (Scroll down for Austin)

This main raw dataset consists of 11,659 listings from 2008 to 2018 with 96 variables along with Host information, Location, Price, Room type etc., First impression of the data set was each host can list multiple listings across Austin with different prices and availability. We wanted to locate the neighbourhood with high priced listings and how reviews impact the occupancy rate. But we couldnâ€™t find much information on reviews in the main dataset, which led us to using a secondary dataset to include reviews data.
